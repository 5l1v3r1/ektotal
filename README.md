# EKTotal
`EKTotal` is an integrated analysis tool that can automatically analyze the traffic of Drive-by Download attacks. The proposed software package can identify four types of Exploit Kits such as RIG and Magnitude, and more than ten types of attack campaigns such as Seamless and Fobos. EKTotal can also extract exploit codes and malware. The proposed heuristic analysis engine is based on Exploit Kit tracking research conducted since 2017, and is known as team ["nao_sec"](https://twitter.com/nao_sec). EKTotal provides a user-friendly web interface and powerful automated analysis functions. Thus, EKTotal can assist SOC operators and CSIRT members and researchers.

## Features
- Identification of malicious traffic
  - Extract over 10 types of attack campaigns out of enormous traffic data
- Automatic analysis of Exploit Kit
  - Automatically analyzes 4 types of exploit kits, de-obfuscates the exploit codes, and decrypts the malware
- User-friendly Web-UI
  - You can know the result at a glance
